# Julian Podg√≥rski's personal website

This repository contains files which together build my personal portfolio website. 

I have created the site with use of WordPress in an offline environment. 
I used the avventura-lite theme as a base, then I tweaked it to enable the neat moving rectangles to list categories on the main page and individual posts on category pages.
I have translated all pages myself and used the Polylang plugin to enable easy switching between localized versions. 
The site is hosted on GitHub pages as a static website. The static version was generated from the WordPress input with the Staatic plugin.
