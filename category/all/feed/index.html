<p class="has-medium-font-size">This &#8220;State of the Arctic&#8221; map from 2016 is a product of my fascination with the Arctic region. As I learned more and more about the area I wanted to be able to confront the different information, look for connections between seemingly unrelated variables. I have pulled data from various scientific and OSINT sources and visualized them with QGIS and graphic design programs. While the map was a personal project born of my curiosity, I have presented it to great interest on the 7th International Geosciences Student Conference in Katowice in July 2016.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">During my time at the Institute of Geophysics I have been engaged in a variety of science communication projects. Among my responsibilities was the design and delivery of webinars directed at school children and the general public. The webinars covered topics of geophysics, technical aspects of remote sensing and cultural matters of the Arctic. Some of them required custom graphical elements such as diagrams and maps, which I have been drawing for the purpose. These works are collected here. I was using Inkscape to create the digital forms of the works, but some of them are based on my pencil-on-paper drawings.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">A poster summarizing the methods and findings of the Master of Science thesis I have defended in the Department of Geography and Regional Studies of the University of Warsaw. The poster contains graphs created for the purpose of the thesis and text in Polish. I have attempted to present the study as a logical succession of goals, methods and results with a central arch driving the viewer&#8217;s eyes through the boxes in the intended order.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Master&#8217;s thesis I have been working on in 2015-2017 was devoted to detection of glacier on LANDSAT imagery. I have taken an approach of iterative testing of image processing parameters and included steps &#8211; such as whether the LANDSAT image should be resampled into a finer resolution or if edge-detection filter was needed. The result has been tested against LiDAR-based maps sourced from the Institute of Geophysics of Polish Academy of Sciences. The test subjects were Arie and Hans glaciers located on Spitsbergen.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The two maps shown have been created for my doctoral dissertation. They show locations of the two glaciers discussed in the thesis: Universidad and San Quintin in Chile. One map shows the location of Universidad glacier within Central Chile (Dry Andes) and location of Dry Andes within Chile, alongside a plot of positive degree days and annual precipitation sum in the 21st century. The second map depicts the location of San Quintin glacier within Southern Chile (the North Patagonian Icefield) and location of the North Patagonian Icefield within Chile. </p>

<p>The last article I have published during my time at the Institute of Geophysics of Polish Academy of Sciences covers a study of surface debris cover of Universidad glacier in Chilean Andes. The work showcases a multifaceted methodology, combining several remote sensing products to create a conceptual model of the processes occurring on the glacier&#8217;s surface.</p>



<p>We have used an aerial hyperspectral image as ground truth to establish a model to convert LANDSAT reflectance values to abundance of rock and ice within each pixel of an image. Classification of high resolution imagery with machine learning algorithms, which yielded detailed map of types of surface across the glacier. The variables describing the glacier&#8217;s surface have been compared to precipitation and positive degree days sums drawn from ERA5-Land reanalysis. In addition we used digital elevation models to study changes in surface drainage patterns on the glacial tongue.</p>



<p>The article shows gradual evolution of the Universidad glacier&#8217;s surface. It appears that the debris cover on the glacier expands, particularly on the tongue and glacier&#8217;s minor cirques. The latter are also shrinking and have detached from the glacier&#8217;s main body by 2020.</p>



<p>The project which yielded the publication has been partially financed with a National Science Center of Poland grant from the PRELUDIUM programme. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">In this article I present the methods and results of the work I have been doing with Micha≈Ç Pƒôtlicki, PhD, in the field of iceberg remote sensing. The article contains a detailed description of a procedure for detection of icebergs on high-resolution satellite imagery and a discussion of the statistical properties of the population of icebergs in the proglacial lake of the San Quintin glacier in southern Chile. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We used high-resolution satellite images and a digital elevation model derived from them to create a map of icebergs. The challenge of the task lied in the similarity of the sediment-laden lake water and the surfaces of the icebergs covered in the same sediments. The seemingly complex procedure involving object-based image analysis, machine learning classification and computer vision algorithms led to successful detections. Mathematical analysis showed that the distribution of iceberg sizes in the lacustrine environment is similar to that of marine icebergs.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">My second article published in a peer-reviewed journal is primarily a fairly technical text, dealing with quality assessment of an elevation model TanDEM-X DEM shortly after its release by the German Space Agency in 2016. We have tackled the question whether the new product is suitable for glaciological studies, particularly elevation change detection. The model was compared to previously existing products (ASTER DEM and SRTM DEM) and an airborne LiDAR-scanning derived model.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The work summarized in the article demonstrated that TanDEM-X DEM is sufficiently accurate for glaciological change detection. To prove this, medium-term geodetic mass balance of a Chilean mountain glaicier has been computed. We have shown that Universidad glacier in central Chile has been melting in the first decade of the 21st century on almost its entire surface. In particular, the surface lowering (melting) was especially strong on its tongue, leading to development of local topography.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">My first peer-reviewed journal article is a summary of work I have done with Polish and Canadian scientists. We have used terrestrial laser scanning data, and MATLAB programming language to develop a model of gradual change of reflectivity of a glacier&#8217;s front after an iceberg calves off. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Laser scanning (LiDAR) provides a detailed 3D model of the scanned object as well as information about reflectivity &#8211; how much of the laser beam emitted towards the target returns to the scanner. In this article it has been demonstrated, that the surface of the front of a calving glacier changes with time after an iceberg calves off. The freshly revealed surface of the glacial ice undergoes weathering caused by solar radiation and precipitation and gradually brightens &#8211; changing in appearance from relatively dark, blue glacial ice to a white, rough surface of transformed ice.</p>
