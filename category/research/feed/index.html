<p>The last article I have published during my time at the Institute of Geophysics of Polish Academy of Sciences covers a study of surface debris cover of Universidad glacier in Chilean Andes. The work showcases a multifaceted methodology, combining several remote sensing products to create a conceptual model of the processes occurring on the glacier&#8217;s surface.</p>



<p>We have used an aerial hyperspectral image as ground truth to establish a model to convert LANDSAT reflectance values to abundance of rock and ice within each pixel of an image. Classification of high resolution imagery with machine learning algorithms, which yielded detailed map of types of surface across the glacier. The variables describing the glacier&#8217;s surface have been compared to precipitation and positive degree days sums drawn from ERA5-Land reanalysis. In addition we used digital elevation models to study changes in surface drainage patterns on the glacial tongue.</p>



<p>The article shows gradual evolution of the Universidad glacier&#8217;s surface. It appears that the debris cover on the glacier expands, particularly on the tongue and glacier&#8217;s minor cirques. The latter are also shrinking and have detached from the glacier&#8217;s main body by 2020.</p>



<p>The project which yielded the publication has been partially financed with a National Science Center of Poland grant from the PRELUDIUM programme. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">In this article I present the methods and results of the work I have been doing with Michał Pętlicki, PhD, in the field of iceberg remote sensing. The article contains a detailed description of a procedure for detection of icebergs on high-resolution satellite imagery and a discussion of the statistical properties of the population of icebergs in the proglacial lake of the San Quintin glacier in southern Chile. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We used high-resolution satellite images and a digital elevation model derived from them to create a map of icebergs. The challenge of the task lied in the similarity of the sediment-laden lake water and the surfaces of the icebergs covered in the same sediments. The seemingly complex procedure involving object-based image analysis, machine learning classification and computer vision algorithms led to successful detections. Mathematical analysis showed that the distribution of iceberg sizes in the lacustrine environment is similar to that of marine icebergs.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">My second article published in a peer-reviewed journal is primarily a fairly technical text, dealing with quality assessment of an elevation model TanDEM-X DEM shortly after its release by the German Space Agency in 2016. We have tackled the question whether the new product is suitable for glaciological studies, particularly elevation change detection. The model was compared to previously existing products (ASTER DEM and SRTM DEM) and an airborne LiDAR-scanning derived model.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The work summarized in the article demonstrated that TanDEM-X DEM is sufficiently accurate for glaciological change detection. To prove this, medium-term geodetic mass balance of a Chilean mountain glaicier has been computed. We have shown that Universidad glacier in central Chile has been melting in the first decade of the 21st century on almost its entire surface. In particular, the surface lowering (melting) was especially strong on its tongue, leading to development of local topography.</p>

We have used terrestrial laser scanning data, and MATLAB programming language to develop a model of gradual change of reflectivity of a glacier&#8217;s front after an iceberg calves off. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Laser scanning (LiDAR) provides a detailed 3D model of the scanned object as well as information about reflectivity &#8211; how much of the laser beam emitted towards the target returns to the scanner. In this article it has been demonstrated, that the surface of the front of a calving glacier changes with time after an iceberg calves off. The freshly revealed surface of the glacial ice undergoes weathering caused by solar radiation and precipitation and gradually brightens &#8211; changing in appearance from relatively dark, blue glacial ice to a white, rough surface of transformed ice.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">My first scientific work has been released in a conference proceedings tome published in 2016 after Forum GIS of the University of Warsaw conference. It showcases the results of my first Master thesis I did in Stockholm University. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The topic of the work is the analysis of coastal erosion of a Siberian island as tracked on old American spy satellite imagery. CORONA and KEYHOLE are 1970s satellite survelliance projects which produced imagery on photographic film. The photos have been scanned and released to the public in the 1990s. They are the earliest easily accessible satellite imagery of the Earth&#8217;s surface and thus they lend very well to environmental change detection. I have tracked changes in the course of coastline of an island located in northeastern Siberia between 1968 and 1980 to study erosion of the island&#8217;s ice-laden coasts. The study&#8217;s results showed agreement of the spatial distribution of erosion with the local patterns of oceanic and atmospheric circulation.</p>
